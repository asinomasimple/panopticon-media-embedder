# Panopticon Media Embedder

A simple browser extension that enhances QBN.com threads by embedding media links like:
- Instagram posts
- `.webp` images
- `.mp4` videos

This is a lightweight, personal tool designed for the QBN community. It automatically replaces supported links with inline embeds.

## 🧠 Why?

QBN.com doesn't support Instagram embeds or direct preview of media files. This extension adds that functionality for your own browser and can be shared with others on the site.
